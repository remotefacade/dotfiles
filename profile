# Sample .profile for SUSE Linux
# rewritten by Christian Steinruecken <cstein@suse.de>
#
# This file is read each time a login shell is started.
# All other interactive shells will only read .bashrc; this is particularly
# important for language settings, see below.

test -z "$PROFILEREAD" && . /etc/profile || true

# Some applications read the EDITOR variable to determine your favourite text
# editor. So uncomment the line below and enter the editor of your choice :-)
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nvim

# For some news readers it makes sense to specify the NEWSSERVER variable here
#export NEWSSERVER=your.news.server
